My version of BCOMP

BCOMP - Basic computer was one of the many creations by people of my chair. It can be described as the simple machine, having one memory for both instructions and data, represented by 16-bit words; ALU that carries all the logic; I/O devices and some other stuff.
In this project my version of its interpretator is presented.
